Idioms:

#+begin_src lua
  --  These two lines are equivalent.  That is, they set x to a default value v
  --  when x is not set (provided x is not set to false).
  x = x or v
  if not x then x=v end
#+end_src

#+begin_src lua
  -- The idiom below is equivalent to the C expression a ? b : c.  For instance,
  -- we can select the maximum of two numbers x and y with the expression

  -- (x > y) and x or y

  -- When x > y, the first expression of the and is true, so the and results in
  -- its second operand (x), which is always true (because it is a number), and
  -- then the or expression results in the value of its first operand, x. When x >
  -- y is false, the and expression is false and so the or results in its second
  -- operand, y.
  a and b or c
